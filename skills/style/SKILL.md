# Style

General guidelines for writing clean, maintainable code.

## Git Repository Requirement

Agents must only operate within git repositories. Before performing any work:

1. Verify the current working directory is inside a git repository
2. If not in a git repository, refuse to proceed

Without a git repository, it's too hard to succeed with agents - changes can't be tracked, reviewed, or safely reverted.

## Documentation

### Avoiding Redundant Comments

Code should be self-documenting. Do not add comments that describe what the code obviously does:

```
// Bad - obvious comments
// Base configuration type for all backends
BaseConfigArgs = { level: LogLevel }

// Good - let code speak for itself
BaseConfigArgs = { level: LogLevel }
```

Decorative comment blocks (ASCII art dividers, section headers) add visual noise without providing meaningful information.

**When comments ARE useful:**

- Complex algorithms that aren't immediately obvious
- Non-obvious workarounds or edge cases
- TODO/FIXME/XXX markers for future work
- Business logic that requires explanation

```
// XXX - Temporary workaround until upstream fix
// TODO - Switch to newMethod when minimum version is bumped
result = await legacyMethod()
```

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

- **Summary line**: Max 72 characters, non-empty
- **Blank line**: Required between summary and body (if body exists)
- **Body lines**: Max 72 characters each

Summary lines should be English sentences with no abbreviations, no markup (e.g. feat, chore), and not end with punctuation.

**Good examples:**

```
Add retry logic for failed network requests

Fix race condition in transaction verification

Document API response format
```

**Bad examples:**

```
feat: add retry logic
Update code (too vague)
Fix bug in server.ts (includes filename)
```

## Documentation Maintenance

When making changes to code, check whether related documentation needs updating:

- README files that reference changed functionality
- API documentation for modified interfaces
- Inline comments that describe changed behavior
- Configuration examples that no longer apply

Update documentation in the same commit as the code change, not as a separate task.

## Code Reuse and Refactoring

Do not reimplement functionality that already exists in the codebase. Before writing new code:

1. Search for existing implementations that could serve the same purpose
2. If similar functionality exists, prefer refactoring it to meet the new requirements
3. Look for unexported functions in other packages that could be promoted to a shared location

When a refactor might be necessary, prompt the user with specific options:

- Refactor the existing implementation
- Promote an unexported function to a shared package
- Create a new implementation

Allow the user to provide their own answer if none of the options fit.

## Build Verification

Always run the full build command before declaring any task complete.

- Individual package builds do not guarantee the full tree will build
- Do not work around a failing build by running individual targets and treating their success as equivalent
- If the build fails, report the failure to the user and identify the cause
- If the failure is pre-existing and unrelated to your changes, say so explicitly and let the user decide how to proceed

Never silently skip a failing step or substitute a partial build.

## Configuration Files

Do not modify configuration files (e.g. eslint, prettier, tsconfig) unless explicitly asked. Focus on writing working software, not changing the conventions that are being used.

## Personality

Do not use emojis in code or documentation. Act professionally.

## Acknowledgment

At the start of a session, after reviewing this skill, state: "I have reviewed the style skill, and I am ready to proceed in good taste."
